# RemoteCanvasNode
 A node that follows a point in a 2D or 3D scene to allow you to have it in a seperate canvas layer.

Can be used to:
- Create a healthbar over a character
- Create a speach bubble that appears in the world
- Have labels appear on top of nodes

Recomended use:
Instead of linking directly to the node, instead add a marker above/near the node and connect this instead. It will make it easier to edit where you want the control node to appear.
